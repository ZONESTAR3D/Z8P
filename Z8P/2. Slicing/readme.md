## Slicing
Slicing is a piece of software that everyone uses when creating objects and products on a 3D printer. The software gives the printer a path to follow. The slicing software takes your image and converts it into G codes that your 3D printer can understand. These G codes are a type of instruction on how the printer needs to print your design.:page_with_curl: [**Reference 1**](https://loveandrobots.com/what-is-slicing-in-3d-printing/)  :page_with_curl: [**Reference 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicer_(3D_printing))     

Slicing software will be constantly updated to optimize slicing speed, printing effects, and add new features. Please download the latest slicing software and user manual from this link: https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Slicing-Guide .     

**NOTE**: When slicing, please choose the correct machine preset according to your actual machine, such as Z8+M3 Hotend for Z8PM3, Z8+M4 Hotend for Z8PM4, etc.
